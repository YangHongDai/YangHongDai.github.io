## About Me

I am a dedicated radiation oncologist with a deep passion for the crossroads of oncology and immunology. My professional journey is driven by a commitment to advancing cancer treatment through innovative technologies and research.

After completing my medical training and specializing in radiation oncology, I became increasingly interested in the immune system’s role in cancer therapy. This fascination led me to explore the promising fields of deep learning and bioinformatics, where I apply these advanced analytical techniques to enhance treatment precision and outcomes.

Currently, I am deeply involved in unraveling the complexities of Radiopharmaceutical therapy, focusing particularly on Lu-177 PSMA therapy. This innovative treatment targets prostate cancer with remarkable precision, and I am investigating its potential to activate the immune system against cancer cells. My research aims not only to refine therapeutic strategies but also to pave the way for new paradigms in cancer treatment that integrate immunological mechanisms with radiological technologies.

As I continue my work, I am eager to collaborate with fellow experts in oncology, immunology, and bioinformatics to further our understanding and improve patient outcomes in the fight against cancer. I look forward to sharing insights and exploring new possibilities at the intersection of these exciting fields.
